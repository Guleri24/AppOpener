# A note from author

As a beginner in the field of programming, I began learning the Python programming language and quickly discovered the potential for automation. One area of interest for me was the ability to automate the opening of applications. Through my research, I discovered the "Get-StartApps" command and was impressed by the ability to access the names and identifiers of all installed applications. I then began development on a project called "AppOpener" in July 2022, and was eventually able to successfully release it.

However, shortly before the release, I discovered a similar library that also aimed to accomplish the same task, but I found that it lacked some of the features that I had incorporated into my own project.
