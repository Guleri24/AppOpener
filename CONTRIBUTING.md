### Contributing via Development üë®‚Äçüíª

It's time to start development:

1. Fork the repo if you haven't already 

2. Clone your fork locally 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AppOpener.git
```
Replace "YOUR_USERNAME" with your GitHub username

3. Once you've cloned the repository, you'll need to create a new branch to store your changes. A branch is a separate version of the code that you can work on without affecting the main codebase.
```sh
git branch local
```
Now switch to that branch via:
```sh
git checkout local
```
4. You can now make your changes to the code. When you're ready to commit your changes, run the following commands:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE"
```
Replace "COMMIT_MESSAGE" with a short, descriptive message that explains the changes you've made.

5. Finally, you can push your changes to your fork of the repository by running the following command:
```sh
git push origin local
```
This will upload your changes to your fork of the repository on GitHub.

6. To submit your changes to the main project, you'll need to create a pull request. To do this, go to the GitHub page for your fork of the repository and click the "New pull request" button. Follow the prompts to create a pull request, and then submit it to the project's maintainers for review.
